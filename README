This is a program I wrote a few years ago to extract graphics and sound data
from Humongous Entertainment games. I had even less of a grasp of good coding
style and practices then than I do now, so the whole thing is quite atrocious --
nonsensical class structure, homebrew utilities instead of libraries for
exporting graphics, the works. I also developed it without reference to
ScummVM's source as a "personal challenge", so some things aren't even
implemented correctly. I've tested it on the most common releases of pretty much
every game Humongous made, though, so it should work unless you're trying to
extract data from something exotic. See readme.txt for the explanation of the
program that was included with the original release.

For licensing purposes, everything here is GNU GPL3. Whatever DrMcCoy may think,
I maintain that this is not worth the trouble of copy-pasting a big ugly legal
notice.
